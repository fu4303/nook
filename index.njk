<p>Welcome to my library of whiskies. My journey into whisky is both short and long. For many years, friends had tried to introduce me to it and I shuddered with every sip. For some reason, it did not do anything for me. I preferred to stick to my screwdrivers and long islands. </p>

<p>Something clicked and ever since, I have had the opportunity to explore many whiskies from many regions. I have quickly grown my personal collection of whiskies over the last few years.</p>

<p>Of course, people have different tastes. These are mine. I wanted a place to document what I've tried and remember what I have in my collection. I hope you enjoy this, too.</p>
