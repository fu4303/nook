Welcome to the Snook Nook, where I keep track of the whiskies in my collection. I take notes of what I've tried and hope you enjoy them, too. 

### Rating System

The rating system I'm using is based on [t8ke's system](https://t8ke.review/scoring-highlights/). I think it provides a well-balanced rating while not skewing everything into a 20 point band. 

1. **Disgusting.** So bad, I poured it out.
2. **Poor.** I wouldn't consume it by choice.
3. **Bad.** Multiple flaws.
4. **Underwhelming**. Tolerable.
5. **Good.** 
6. **Very Good.**
7. **Great.** Above average.
8. **Excellent.** Really quite exceptional.
9. **Incredible.** An all-time favourite that I'll recommend relentlessly.
10. **Perfect.** Nearly unobtainable.

Slainte!
