		<title>Laphroaig Cairdeas Triple Wood</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/laphroaig-cairdeas-triple-wood/"/>

      &lt;p&gt;Each year, Laphroaig releases a cask-strength edition and in 2019, they did the Triple Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Triple Wood is matured in ex-bourbon barrels, then in quarter casks, and finally in oloroso sherry casks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this Islay scotch comes through with a lot of rich, smokey flavour. On the nose, it’s like bacon, syrup, deep honey, and, of course, that smokiness. (I could really go for some BBQ right now.) On the palate, the taste of raisins comes through. And finally, on the finish, sweet, sweet caramel. So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month later, I had another dram and I swear I could smell peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its strong 59.5% ABV, I think this whisky works well without any water. Interestingly, though, Laphroaig recommends twice as much water as whisky. Adding water can definitely bring out some interesting new flavours but a 2-to-1 ratio? I’ll have to try it and report back.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Nikka Coffey Grain</title>

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/nikka-coffey-grain.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When there’s a whisky that I’d pick to introduce people to Japanese whisky or just whisky in general, this is the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly, they’ll remark how it doesn’t taste like coffee. Which, it shouldn’t. Coffey (not coffee) is the type of still that the whisky is made in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sweet caramel sugar on the nose and on the palate. It’s very smooth and easy to drink. It’s at a decent 45.6% ABV that doesn’t need any water added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikka Coffey Grain is one of my favourite whiskies and it’s a great bang for the buck. Here in Ontario, Canada, it’s $90 and I’ve seen it for as low as $55 in the States. I keep this one well-stocked and ready to go at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Black Art 6.1</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/black-art-61/"/>

		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/black-art.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bruichladdich is such an interesting distillery with unique, flavourful expressions. The main Bruichladdich line—which includes the Black Art series—are unpeated Islay whiskies. Islay is known for its peat and the distilleries there, like Laphroaig and Lagavulin, are known for their smokey expressions. Bruichladdich has its Port Charlotte and Octomore lines for those more interested in the smokiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are here to talk about Black Art and, in particular, the 6.1. I have heard that the 4.1 is probably the best of the Black Art series but here in Ontario, if it isn’t offered by the provincial liquor store monopoly, then you’ll have to travel and bring it back with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I can’t currently get my hands on the 4.1, I could get my hands on the 6.1. And I’m not disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour is surprisingly dark, although it is a 26 year old whisky. On the nose, I’m reminded of childhood memories at the  pool with a hint of chlorine and a strong fruit flavour like cherry ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going down, there’s vanilla and, again, a strong fruit flavour. This time, more like a strawberry-flavoured candy. Finally, I’m left with dryness and saltiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much character to this whisky. I look forward to one day trying the other Black Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Nikka Coffey Malt</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/nikka-coffey-malt/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-23T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/nikka-coffey-malt/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/nikka-coffey-malt.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Considering how much I love Coffey Grain, will I love the Coffey Malt just as much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coffey Grain is made from corn, giving it that mellowness. The Malt, on the other hand, is made from malted barley. It’s still considered a grain whisky, though, because it is distilled in the coffey still and not a pot still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coffey Malt comes in at 45% ABV, just like its sibling. Online review sites describe this as more fruity and spicy. My own personal notes, I found a more medicinal scent on the nose. Maybe something like a vodka flavour. On the palate, though, I could taste the maltiness and oak along with a spicy kick and then a smooth, sweet finish with a hint of vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Malt definitely has more character than the Grain but I don’t love it as much. Still decent, though. I don’t mind keeping room on the shelf for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Octomore 10.1</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/octomore-101/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-25T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/octomore-101/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/octomore-101.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have a love affair with Bruichladdich. Black Art, Octomore, Port Charlotte. So many delightfully tasty whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Octomore 10.1 is a 5 year old scotch with a lot of peat. 107 parts per million, according to the bottle. Which seems like a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve enjoyed a few drams from this bottle and each time, I am delighted and continue to find new flavours. Initially, it was all about the smokiness—but one that differentiates itself from the kind of smoke you get from Lagavulin, Laphroaig, or Ardbeg. This evening, I swear I was reminded of wintergreen mint Life Savers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the palate, the flavour was intense but not quite with the same complexity as the nose. The smoke is still there but a sweetness comes through, as well, along with a hint of ginger. At a strong 59.8% ABV, I find adding some water definitely helps settle the intensity and lets some other earthy flavours come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to get my hands on the entire Octomore collection to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Aberlour A’bunadh</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/aberlour-abunadh/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-27T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/aberlour-abunadh/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/aberlour-abunadh.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One day, in the dark recesses of the internet, I came upon a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forwhiskeylovers.com/sites/default/files/user/20168/photos/Scotch%20chart.jpg&quot;&gt;flavour map&lt;/a&gt; that attempts to place various Scotch whiskies on a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the top were those that were rich, being more sherry and fruit forward. Along the bottom were those that were lighter and more caramel forward. Along the left were peated and spicy. Finally, along the right were unpeated whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danrubin&quot;&gt;Dan Rubin&lt;/a&gt; that it’s useful in Photoshop to adjust a slider to its extremes to make it easier to see the effects it would have on the image. Then you can dial it back to something that is more modest and appropriate for the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a similar approach with whiskies. Go to the extremes to experience the intensity and then dial it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light and soft corner were the Balvenie DoubleWood and Auchentoshan. The DoubleWood is smooth and easy to drink. It’s probably the first Scotch I tried that really hit the mark for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the peat and caramel corner is Octomore and Port Charlotte. I’ve mentioned how much I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/posts/octomore-101/&quot;&gt;a fan of Bruichladdich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the heavy sherry and peat is Ardbeg Uigeadail and Laphroaig Triplewood. Absolutely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final corner are the sherry monsters. The Aberlour A’bunadh sits nice and close to that corner. And oh boy is it tasty. I really enjoy the sherry influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose, I found it musty along with cherry, a hint of orange, and definitely that oloroso sherry influence. That sherry follows through on the palate. So rich and delicious. The fruity sherry finish leaves some spice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batch 66 comes in at a cask strength of 59.2%. I like it neat, without water. At $100 (Canadian), I think this is a great value for a great Scotch whisky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having tried the extremes, I don’t think I’ll be dialing it back anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bunnahabhain 1997 Palo Cortado Cask Finish</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/bunna-1997-palo-cortado/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-28T00:00:00-00:00</updated>

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/bunna-1997-palo-cortado.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Despite being located on Islay, known for its peated whiskies, Bunnahabhain produces mostly unpeated whiskies, including the 1997 Palo Cortado Cask Finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expression is aged for 19 years in traditional oak and then finished for 2 more years in Palo Cortado sherry casks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming in at 54.9% ABV, I didn’t add any water. On the nose, a light buttery smell seems most prominent along with a deeper sweetness more like port or raisins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the palate, it is rich and spicy with cherry and nutmeg. Then I’m left with a dry finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At $600 (Canadian) for a bottle (and only 1644 bottles in existence), I’d recommend getting this only if you have a particular affinity for Bunnahabhain. It’s tasty but not sure it’s hundreds-of-dollars tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Macallan 25</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/macallan-25/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-28T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/macallan-25/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/macallan-25.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m not normally a fan of Macallan but thought I’d give a high-end expression of it a try. Considering how pricey this 2019 release is, maybe I could be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The packaging is lovely. A wooden case held closed with magnets opens up to a liner describing the whisky and two wooden slats holding the bottle in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my first opening of the bottle, I gave a pour, added some water, and let it breathe for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose, a definite maple syrup smell comes through but on the palate, I find the taste rather muted and underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maple syrup isn’t a tasting note mentioned on the Macallan web site, so I’m trying it again. This time, I’m not noticing the maple syrup smell I had last time. Now, I’m getting a strong oak with citrus. Definitely closer to what Macallan says to expect; although, I’m still not getting the cinnamon they mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the palate, I’m noticing the cinnamon but still, overall, rather underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Thirty minutes later.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glass, nearly empty, has been sitting there. I lift it up to finish off the last gulp that remains and… there’s that maple syrup smell again. So odd. It’s still not enough to redeem this rather mediocre whisky, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that I’m not a fan of Macallan and spending more money definitely hasn’t changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/balvenie-14-caribbean/"/>

      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/balvenie-14-caribbean.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask is aged in traditional oak casks for 14 years and then finished in rum casks, although Balvenie doesn’t say for how long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14 Year comes in at an easy 43% ABV. I haven’t added any water to my glass, but you do you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose, it’s fresh and fruity. Like oranges and citrus and maybe even a hint of cherry. It follows through on the palate, filling the mouth with sweet goodness that coats the mouth and leaves that fruitiness along with some honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s $145 (Canadian) and I think it’s totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Balvenie 15 Year Single Barrel Sherry Cask</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/balvenie-15-sherry/"/>
		<updated>2020-06-29T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/balvenie-15-sherry/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/balvenie-15-sherry.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Balvenie was one of the first distillers that I got into. When I get into something, I tend to go all-in on something and started buying all the whiskies that Balvenie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Balvenie 15 Year Single Barrel Sherry Cask is matured in a  European Oak Oloroso sherry butt that yields 800 bottles. Sounds amazing. It has an ABV of 47.8% which is lower than I would’ve expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bottle has been sitting on my shelf, about three-quarters full, for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to it after all these years, I noticed an earthy, musty, plant smell. Like a dank basement. It’s sherry cask! This should be rich and delicious and it’s anything but. Did my bottle go bad? I’ve heard such a thing is rare but I don’t know how else to explain how this tastes so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reluctant to spring for another bottle of this to test my theory that mine has simply gone bad. Maybe I’ll find it someday on a shelf at some bar and I’ll spring for a dram in hopes that this expression is actually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Port Charlotte MRC:01 2010</title>
		<link href="https://nook.snook.ca/posts/port-charlotte-mrc01/"/>
		<updated>2020-07-04T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
		<id>https://nook.snook.ca/posts/port-charlotte-mrc01/</id>
		<content type="html">
      &lt;img src=&quot;https://nook.snook.ca/img/port-charlotte-mrc1.jpg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Port Charlotte is a line of heavily peated whiskies from Bruichladdich, a distiller from Islay—an island known for its peat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MRC:01 is a 7 year old whisky distilled in 2010 and spends its time in first-fill American whiskey casks and second-fill French wine casks. Then combined together to spend another year in French oak from Bordeaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose, I notice orange and grass. It’s peaty but it doesn’t have the meaty or ashy smokiness of a Laphroaig or Lagavulin. There’s a saltiness like that of an ocean breeze. It feels light and cooling. The Bruichladdich site describes additional notes of vanilla, toast, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and more, but I don’t notice them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 59.2% ABV, it’s intense on the palate. Medicinal and oaky, with a faint sweetness carrying it. On an earlier dram, I even noticed something akin to tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the finish, an ashiness that wasn’t there on the nose comes through strong. It’s like an ashtray in the back of my throat and I’m left with a dryness. There’s a bit of heat that lingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back for a second sniff, the ash is more prominent and I begin to notice the nuttiness and toast smells coming through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I add some water and notice the oakiness even more. It’s not as harsh on the palate but I’m not finding the water bringing out anything new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the MRC:01 an interesting whisky—as evidenced by the bottle being over half empty already. Bruichladdich doesn’t say how many of this limited release were bottled but I’ll definitely be sad to see this one disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
