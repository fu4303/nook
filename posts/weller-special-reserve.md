Talking about bourbons doesn’t seem quite as exciting as talking about scotch. With fairly strict requirements around ingredients and casks, there isn’t much to add. 

Weller Special Reserve has no age statement but replaces the rye in the recipe with wheat. As such, on the nose, it has more of a cereal note but still plenty of that caramel corn smell, as well. 

On the palate, there’s almost a cherry cough syrup taste that comes through. I kinda want to pair this with a cherry coke. I like this better than the EH Taylor Small Batch but I’m still unconvinced when it comes to drinking bourbon.
