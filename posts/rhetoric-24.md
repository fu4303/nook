Orphan Barrel is a distiller from Tullahoma, Tennessee, focused on making rare whiskies. The Rhetoric series is a gradual aging from 20 to 25 years. I picked up the 24 in hopes of finding a bourbon that hits the spot. 

On the nose, there’s a strong smell of cherry syrup with a bit of cinnamon and orange peel. There’s also a rounded, almost chemical smell that I just can’t place. 

On the palate, it’s smooth and easy. Oh, this is the first time I’ve actually noticed that dark chocolate flavour come through. It, along with that cherry, reminds me of Lowney Cherry Blossoms I’d have when I was younger. 

Finally, there’s a hint of a lingering spice but overall, super smooth. 

I found a bourbon I enjoy. (And look at that…the 25 is available at the liquor store near me.)
