When there’s a whisky that I’d pick to introduce people to Japanese whisky or just whisky in general, this is the one. 

Whenever people hear “Coffey”, they’ll either hear “coffee” or, if written, they’ll misread it as such. As a result, people are often surprised by the lack of any coffee flavour. Indeed, there is no coffee or coffee influence in this whisky. Coffey is in reference to the kind of still the whisky is made in.
