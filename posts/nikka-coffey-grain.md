When there’s a whisky that I’d pick to introduce people to Japanese whisky or just whisky in general, this is the one. 

Amusingly, they’ll remark how it doesn’t taste like coffee. Which, it shouldn’t. Coffey (not coffee) is the type of still that the whisky is made in. 

It’s sweet caramel sugar on the nose and on the palate. It’s very smooth and easy to drink. It’s at a decent 45.6% ABV that doesn’t need any water added. 

Nikka Coffey Grain is one of my favourite whiskies and it’s a great bang for the buck. Here in Ontario, Canada, it’s $90 and I’ve seen it for as low as $55 in the States. I keep this one well-stocked and ready to go at any time.
