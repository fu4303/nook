      <p>From the Barrel is a blend of single malt and grain whiskies from both the Miyagikyo and Yoichi distilleries. This whisky apparently won in the World Whisky Awards back in 2007 and again in 2010.</p>
<p>On the nose, I smell orange and caramel sweetness along with a light floral note in there. There’s definitely a similar sweet note as the Nikka Coffey Grain but with a couple more things added on top.</p>
<p>At 51.4% ABV, it definitely brings some more spice and heat than the Coffey Grain. It goes down warm, leaving the mouth a bit dry along with notes of nutmeg.</p>
<p>I added some water which brought out a creaminess on the nose. It definitely mellows it out on the palate but maybe a bit too much. (I may have added too much water and I didn’t think I had!) I think I prefer this one without the water added. The complexity disappears otherwise.</p>
<p>From the Barrel is inexpensive, retailing for $70 here in Canada. (Not that stores in Ontario have any more.) Personally, I still prefer the Coffey Grain as my go-to but if you want a bit more complexity and heat, I think From the Barrel is worth a go.</p>
