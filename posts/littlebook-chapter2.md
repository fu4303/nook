Little Book is a yearly release by Freddie Noe, son of current Beam master Distiller, Fred Noe. Chapter 2, “Noe Simple Task”, came out in 2018. 

This Little Book is a blend of 8-year Kentucky Straight Rye, 40-year Canadian whisky—which makes me think it’s Canadian Club, and a 13-year Canadian rye. One site says the 40-year was 100% corn but Canadian Club 40 Year is a blend of 3 mash bills, of which only one is 100% corn. (Another being 100% rye and the last a blend of rye, malted rye, and malted barley.)

It’s a hefty 59.4% ABV. The first time I tried this months ago, it was strong and didn’t really appeal. Today, let’s see how it goes.

On the nose, I definitely notice the bourbon at its core but there also seems to be a floral note that almost reminds me of something gin-like. On the palate, it’s definitely still intense, just like last time, but I’m noticing the spice and sweetness come through. The sweetness is fruity but like a Fruity Pebbles cereal.  I’m definitely enjoying this more now than the first time I had tried it. 

This whisky has character but given the Canadian content, I expected this one to be smoother than it is. I’m appreciating this one more with each new sip I take. I don’t know that I’d buy this again, though. There are other whiskies that I’m more enamoured with that I’d prefer to spend my money on.
