Despite being located on Islay, known for its peated whiskies, Bunnahabhain produces mostly unpeated whiskies, including the 1997 Palo Cortado Cask Finish. 

This expression is aged for 19 years in traditional oak and then finished for 2 more years in Palo Cortado sherry casks. 

Coming in at 54.9% ABV, I didn’t add any water. On the nose, a light buttery smell seems most prominent along with a deeper sweetness more like port or raisins. 

On the palate, it is rich and spicy with cherry and nutmeg. Then I’m left with a dry finish.

At $600 (Canadian) for a bottle (and only 1644 bottles in existence), I’d recommend getting this only if you have a particular affinity for Bunnahabhain. It’s tasty but not sure it’s hundreds-of-dollars tasty.
