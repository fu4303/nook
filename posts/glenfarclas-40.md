I’ve heard many good things about Glenfarclas and after watching the movie, The Gentlemen, where the 40 is featured prominently, I figured if there was an opportunity to try it, I’d take it. 

Now, getting a particular bottle of whisky in Ontario can be difficult and doubly so during a pandemic. One company is authorized to do auctions in the province and the company puts an auction on every quarter. I took the opportunity to fill out my collection further and the Glenfarclas was just one of those opportunities. 

I cracked it open and the first whiff was buttery sweet. I let it sit in the glencairn and kept going back to smell it some more. After a minute or so, a little but of lemony orange citrus came through. A few minutes more and it deepens into honey, peach, pear, and raisin. The more I wait, the more raisin comes through. I am delighted. 

First sip had a surprising amount of heat that thankfully goes away on subsequent sips. Other reviews I’ve read describe it as oily but I am unsure if that referred to the taste or the texture. Texture-wise, for me, it felt like water, which I rarely get from whisky. It didn’t coat my mouth but rather clung to itself. Taste-wise, though, the initial sweet quickly disappears and is replaced with woodiness, a bit of peppery spice, and a hint of black tea. My mouth is left dry and oaky, like I just had some white wine. 

As I keep going back to this, I’m enamoured by the smell. Every time I bring it up to my nose, I’m delighted. If anything, I’m slightly disappointed by the taste that doesn’t quite live up to that smell. It’s still delightful but not _as_ delightful. The sherry influence lingers in my mouth for minutes afterwards, closing the circle on that lovely nosing. 

I consider this an excellent whisky but one that still has a bit room for improvement.
