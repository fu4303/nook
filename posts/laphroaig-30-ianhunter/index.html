      <p>When I first dipped my toe into Scotch, I stuck primarily to Balvenie—a nice, easy to drink highland single malt.</p>
<p>Then, on a whim, I bought a bottle of Lagavulin, which introduced me to Islay Scotches. Then, I tried the Laphroaig Cairdeas Triple Wood and fell in love.<br>
Here in Ontario, they do allotments where you put your name in and hopefully get picked for the opportunity to buy a bottle. I put my name in, got lucky, and now have a bottle of the Laphroaig 30 in the Nook.</p>
<p>Book 1 is a first in what will be a series of yearly releases in honour of Ian Hunter, the last of the Johnston family to own and manage the Laphroaig distillery. The packaging is definitely lovely, with a plush “book” cover that opens to reveal the bottle laid inset.</p>
<p>The whisky itself is aged in first-fill bourbon barrels. My expectation is that this might be more oak-forward with a more subdued smokiness but let’s give it a try, shall we?</p>
<p>On the nose, the smokiness is definitely there but it doesn’t punch you in the face. It feels light and minty and sweet and I want this smell as a cologne so I could smell it throughout the day.</p>
<p>The first hit on the tongue, those initial smells fill the mouth and then slowly evaporate to reveal more of an ashiness and a very hint of spice. The slightly salty and iodine finish barely lingers, inviting me to have some more.</p>
<p>That oakiness that I thought might be the overpowering flavour is barely there—which, in my opinion, is great. Each sniff reveals a bit more. A hint of honey.</p>
<p>I suddenly have a craving for cheese. I sliced up some parmesan and Roquefort that I picked up earlier today.  The parmesan turns out not to be a great pairing. The deeper umami negates some of the flavour. The Roquefort, on the other hand, is delightful. Its softer, creamier flavour pairs better—especially when drizzled with a touch of honey.</p>
<p>It’s 46.7% ABV and while the Scots might suggest to add water to any scotch, I’m a-okay not adding an ounce to this fine dram. It’s perfect just the way it is.</p>
