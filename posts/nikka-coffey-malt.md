Considering how much I love Coffey Grain, will I love the Coffey Malt just as much?

The Coffey Grain is made from corn, giving it that mellowness. The Malt, on the other hand, is made from malted barley. It’s still considered a grain whisky, though, because it is distilled in the coffey still and not a pot still. 

The Coffey Malt comes in at 45% ABV, just like its sibling. Online review sites describe this as more fruity and spicy. My own personal notes, I found a more medicinal scent on the nose. Maybe something like a vodka flavour. On the palate, though, I could taste the maltiness and oak along with a spicy kick and then a smooth, sweet finish with a hint of vanilla. 

The Malt definitely has more character than the Grain but I don’t love it as much. Still decent, though. I don’t mind keeping room on the shelf for this one.
