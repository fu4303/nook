      <p>My experience with whisky has been limited mostly to Japan, Scotland, and the good ol’ U.S of A. Maybe oddly, despite my residence, I haven’t explored much in the way of Canadian whiskies.</p>
<p>Collingwood is made north west of Toronto, off the coast of Georgian Bay with a blend of corn, rye, and barley. Aged in white oak barrels, blended, and then rested with   toasted maplewood staves to finish it off.</p>
<p>On the nose, Collingwood has a strong cereal note with a light fruity apple scent. Like oatmeal with fresh apple slices on top.</p>
<p>Swirl it around the glass and you’ll see that this definitely has legs. Marzipan comes through on the palate. Definitely more complex than a bourbon but overly so.  The finish is warm and drying.</p>
<p>The Collingwood website says the whisky goes well neat or in a cocktail. I decided to whip up some simple syrup and make myself a whisky sour. The taste of the whisky comes through and adds a lovely flavour to the sour.</p>
<p>At $35 (Canadian), I think this is a great mixer that is still decent (if maybe somewhat unremarkable) neat.</p>
