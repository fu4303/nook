From the Barrel is a blend of single malt and grain whiskies from both the Miyagikyo and Yoichi distilleries. This whisky apparently won in the World Whisky Awards back in 2007 and again in 2010. 

On the nose, I smell orange and caramel sweetness along with a light floral note in there. There’s definitely a similar sweet note as the Nikka Coffey Grain but with a couple more things added on top. 

At 51.4% ABV, it definitely brings some more spice and heat than the Coffey Grain. It goes down warm, leaving the mouth a bit dry along with notes of nutmeg. 

I added some water which brought out a creaminess on the nose. It definitely mellows it out on the palate but maybe a bit too much. (I may have added too much water and I didn’t think I had!) I think I prefer this one without the water added. The complexity disappears otherwise. 

From the Barrel is inexpensive, retailing for $70 here in Canada. (Not that stores in Ontario have any more.) Personally, I still prefer the Coffey Grain as my go-to but if you want a bit more complexity and heat, I think From the Barrel is worth a go.
