It’s a blisteringly hot day today. The sky opened up and it started to pour. I went out on to my covered porch to watch the rain and enjoy a cigar. What better dram to try with it than the Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve. 

It’s matured in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry casks and Cabernet Sauvignon barriques. It’s a mild 44% ABV. 

On the nose, before I’d had a puff of my cigar, I smelled sweet plum and raisin. Maybe even a hint of green apple. That sweetness follows through on the palate and adds a bit of oakiness. It continues on down with a smooth, easy finish. 

Even after the cigar is done, it’s a deliciously easy pour. Dalmore describes cinnamon, tropical fruits, banana toffee, and vanilla ice cream as expected flavours. I notice the cinnamon and some orange zest but I’ll be damned if I can taste the vanilla ice cream. Although, I could definitely go for some ice cream right now, what with all this heat.  

Maybe I bought in too quickly to the name of the whisky but I really do enjoy having this with a cigar.
