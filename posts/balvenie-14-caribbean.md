The Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask is aged in traditional oak casks for 14 years and then finished in rum casks, although Balvenie doesn’t say for how long. 

The 14 Year comes in at an easy 43% ABV. I haven’t added any water to my glass, but you do you. 

On the nose, it’s fresh and fruity. Like oranges and citrus and maybe even a hint of cherry. It follows through on the palate, filling the mouth with sweet goodness that coats the mouth and leaves that fruitiness along with some honey. 

It’s $145 (Canadian) and I think it’s totally worth it.
