Having just had some of the Cigar Malt, I thought it’d be interesting to try the Port Wood right afterwards. Aged in American white oak ex-bourbon casks and aged Tawny Port pipes, I’m expecting some deep raisin with this one. 

Interestingly, while I do sense some of the raisin, it’s not the dominant smell. Instead, I’m getting more of a bread-like scent, leaning into pretzel territory. Bizarrely, and I hate to say this, but I’m getting a hint of mac and cheese. I feel like this would pair well with a blue cheese. 

On the palate, there’s definitely some spice there, like cinnamon and nutmeg, and has some heat going down. I’ve added some water now to lessen the heat and see if anything more interesting comes out. Orange comes through on the nose. The water definitely makes it go down more easily. It has a lower, creamier note that I’m finding it difficult to describe. 

Overall, it’s not as sweet as the Cigar Malt. It’s not a bad whisky. I’d drink it if somebody offered it to me but once I run out, I won’t be buying any more of this bottle.
