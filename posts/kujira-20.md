Some purists might argue that a rice spirit can’t be called a whisky. I’m not one of those purists. 

The Kujira 20 is a “rice whisky” that has been aged for 20 years in American bourbon barrels. 

On the nose, it’s rather fascinating, with a sharp, almost chemical, smell and then a candy sweetness follows behind that. It reminds me of those strawberry hard candies that had a soft, liquid center. 

On the palate, it’s like buttery toffee and ginger candy. It’s a sticky sweetness. I’m picturing some spilled Kool Aid that has been sitting out for too long. It doesn’t have quite the same rounded, sake-like mouthfeel that many rice whiskies have but it’s still close. 

And just a hint of spice lingers after it all goes down. 

I think this one was about $300 (U.S.). A bit on the pricey side—although maybe not so much for a 20 year old liquor.
