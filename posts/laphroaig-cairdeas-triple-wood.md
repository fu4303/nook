Each year, Laphroaig releases a cask-strength edition and in 2019, they did the Triple Wood. 

The Triple Wood is matured in ex-bourbon barrels, then in quarter casks, and finally in oloroso sherry casks. 

As such, this Islay scotch comes through with a lot of rich, smokey flavour. On the nose, it’s like bacon, syrup, deep honey, and, of course, that smokiness. (I could really go for some BBQ right now.) On the palate, the taste of raisins comes through. And finally, on the finish, sweet, sweet caramel. So good. 

About a month later, I had another dram and I swear I could smell peanut butter. 

Despite its strong 59.5% ABV, I think this whisky works well without any water. Interestingly, though, Laphroaig recommends twice as much water as whisky. Adding water can definitely bring out some interesting new flavours but a 2-to-1 ratio? I’ll have to try it and report back.
